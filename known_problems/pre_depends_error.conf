<p>
The package(s) in question fail(s) to install or upgrade properly, because a pre-dependent package could not be configured. This is likely due to a dependency cycle.
<br>
Note that it is possible, that aptitude can deal with (some of) such situations (ie upgrades), (by removing the packages first), while apt-get cannot. While it can be argued this is a problem in apt-get, it <b>is</b> also a problem in the package(s) listed below, as both aptitude and apt-get can be used for installing packages.
