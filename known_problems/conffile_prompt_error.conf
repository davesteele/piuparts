<p>
The piuparts upgrade test failed because dpkg detected a conffile as being modified and then prompted the user for an action. As there is no user input, this fails. But this is not the real problem, the real problem is that this prompt shows up in the first place, as there was nobody modifying this conffile at all, the package has just been installed and upgraded...
